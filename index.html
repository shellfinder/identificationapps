                <li><strong>Citizen Science Contribution</strong>: By using iNaturalist, you’re contributing to scientific research. Your observations help scientists track species and monitor biodiversity. How cool is that?</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Perfect For:</strong> Beachcombers who love learning about all aspects of nature and anyone who enjoys being part of a global community of nature lovers.</p>
